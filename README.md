> A soft play area for data!

## Goals

> 1. Very light data analysis
> 2. Very small app prototyping
> 3. Storing Marketing/Ads data

Examples such as the **Programming Flashcards App**, **Google Ads**, **Simple Analytics** research, **Library Data**, and so on. Should involve basically ZERO database admin, unless absolutely necessary.
