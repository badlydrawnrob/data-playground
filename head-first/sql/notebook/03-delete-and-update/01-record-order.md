## Order! Order!

If you don't have a column that _describes_ the order, it's impossible to tell who came first. You can't guarantee that rows are in any logical order; for that to happen you'd need to add:

- A column to describe the order (numerical)
- A column to describe the time (chronological)

So it's possible to add values that describe order. But, should you?

- Do you need historical data?
- Do you need to track over time?
- Or, do you just need the last record?

If you don't need historical data, keep it simple.
