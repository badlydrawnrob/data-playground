## SELECT-INSERT-DELETE

![To avoid mistakes, use a pencil first!](./img/pencil-eraser.jpg)

### If in doubt, use SELECT first

`DELETE` is final. The `WHERE` clause is exactly the same for `SELECT` _and_ `DELETE` â€” so to make sure you don't delete anything you'll regret:

1. **Try `SELECT` first**!
2. Then `INSERT` the new record
3. Finally, `DELETE` the old record

Now you can be confident you won't mess up!
