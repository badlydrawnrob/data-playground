## IN statement

If you're searching for a list of strings, you could do this:

```sql
SELECT name FROM little_black_book
WHERE rating = 'fantastic'
   OR rating = 'hot'
   OR rating = 'smart';
```

But it's far more concise to use `IN`. You pass a list of strings, instead of multiple statements:

```sql
SELECT name FROM little_black_book
WHERE rating IN ('fantastic', 'hot', 'smart');
```
