## IN keyword

```SQL
-- example of operator with IN
SELECT mc.first_name, mc.last_name, mc.phone, jc.title
FROM job_current AS jc
NATURAL JOIN my_contacts AS mc
WHERE jc.title IN (
  SELECT title FROM job_listings  -- #1
);
```

Using the `IN` keyword with an inner join, we can search within a list of values, without having to add them by hand â€” great for dynamically changing records.

1. Returns a list of values
    + Is our job title `IN` this list?

Combined with a parent query, it can be very useful!


### NOT IN

The inverse of `IN`. It returns records that _aren't_ within a list of values:

```SQL
-- example of operator with NOT IN
SELECT mc.first_name, mc.last_name, mc.phone, jc.title
FROM job_current js
NATURAL JOIN my_contacts mc
WHERE jc.title NOT IN (
  SELECT title FROM job_listings
);
```
