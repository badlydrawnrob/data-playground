## IN keyword

```SQL
-- example of operator with IN
```

Using the `IN` keyword with an inner join, we can search within a list of values, without having to add them by hand â€” great for dynamically changing records.

- This inner query should return a _scalar value_
- One query, one row, returning a _single value_ **SHOULD THIS BE IN #02 or #01**?

Combined with a parent query, it can be very useful!


### NOT IN

The inverse of `IN`. It returns records that _aren't_ within a list of values:

```SQL
-- example of operator with NOT IN
