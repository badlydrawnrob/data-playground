## Queries within Queries

A _subquery_ is simple one query, inside another. It's helpful to:

- Search a growing database
- Pass one query (data set) to another query
- Look up one thing first, then perform manipulations
- Answer more than one question

```text
Which x is y
           â¤·
           what Y = ?
```


### Outer and inner query

- A subquery within another query is an _inner query_
- It's parent, is called an _outer query_


### Subqueries within subqueries

Can you write subqueries _inside_ subqueries? Yes! However, you should limit these wherever possible.
