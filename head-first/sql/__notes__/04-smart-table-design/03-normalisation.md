## Normalisation

![](./img/normal.jpg)

Normalisation simply means working with standard rules, making it easier for you and your team to work on together.

- It makes our database easier to search
- It makes our database smaller
- It makes our queries faster!


### 1NF

To achieve First Normal Form (1NF), your tables must follow these rules:

1. Each row of data must contain atomic values
2. Each row of data must be unique
3. Values stored in a column should be of the same type
4. No repeating types of data across columns
5. Columns should have unique names
6. Order of data stored doesn't matter
