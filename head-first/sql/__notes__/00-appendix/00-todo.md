## Look up these ...

1. Tree data structures
2. GraphQL
3. [PSQL equivalent of `SHOW` (chapter 4)](https://bit.ly/2PRzFCE)?
4. Postgres primary key: serial vs integer?
    + [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/787722/postgresql-autoincrement)

11. Research table relationships further, [especially many-to-many](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/218734758-A-beginner-s-guide-to-many-to-many-relationships) and junction tables
12. Other methods of relationships? Or Junctions? arrays? Multiple tags and tag groups?

14. Postgres fine-tuning, best practices (IN, EXISTS, etc)
15. Refresh set theory
16. Write a section on _data cleansing_ with R and Python
17. Write a condensed version, with _images_ and _analogies_
