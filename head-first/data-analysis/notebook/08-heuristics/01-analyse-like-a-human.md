## Analyse like a human

> The real world is wiggly. It has more variables than you can handle.

In an ideal world, you'd be able to connect, process and analyse _all_ the data you'd need to make a decision. Just tweak a few decision variables and <strong class="highlight highlight-uppercase">boom!</strong> you've got the perfect result.

The real world looks like this:

- Many moving parts or variables
- Difficult, expensive, time-consuming to analyse
- Complex mental models
- Too many decision variables

For many tasks, it's **best to simplify**.
