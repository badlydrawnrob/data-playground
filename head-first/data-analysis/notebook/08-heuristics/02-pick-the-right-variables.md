## It's not an ideal world — keep it simple, stupid!

You can't hold all variables in a complex system. Pick the important ones, understand your solutions are probabilities, not absolutes.

- An optimisation function is useful for ultra-specific problems
- **Use heuristics** in most other situations
- **Pick a sensible objective** and the best variables to achieve it
- **Simplify** wherever possible. It often work

**Map out the moving parts** of the system. Ask yourself:

1. List and group your system parts
2. What types of data are there? (quantative or qualitative)
3. Which pieces might give clues to achieve my goal?
4. Which are expensive, time consuming, complex, or impossible?
5. Is your goal reasonable? If not, can you describe why?
6. What is realistic, quick, or easy to gather?
