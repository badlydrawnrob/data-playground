<b class="highlight highlight-bold">Variables can sometimes be linked.</b> Don't assume two variables are independent of each other. Any time you create a model, take care to <i class="highlight highlight-italic">make clear your assumptions</i> on how variables relate to each other.

If you don't think they relate to each other, make this clear too.

- [ ] What is the relationship as a whole (total sales)
    - [ ] Will sales drop?
- [ ] What relationships does it show?
    - [ ] Which to stock?


### The future will change, you can't predict it.

I've got news for you son: all your data is observational, and your model can break at any time. The best you can do is to be clear on your assumptions and mental model (this time), and keep it up-to-date — <i class="highlight highlight-italic">learn as you go</i>.

> **Pimp out your model when things change!** If the landscape (or the data) changes, you need to reassess your assumptions and upgrade your model.

Data analysis is all about <i class="highlight highlight-italic">iteration</i>:

1. How have the relationships changed?
2. How does it compare to last week? Last year?
