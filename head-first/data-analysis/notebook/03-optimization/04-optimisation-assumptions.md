## Optimisation is useless ...
### ... <i>unless</i> we make the right assumptions

In our previous models, we're picturing an ideal world where customers will buy whatever we make. This never happens! (or at least, it's incredibly rare).

😏 Customer assumptions. What will they buy?

![IDEAL vs ACTUAL image]()

<b>Will the sky fall down?</b> Or might you just lose some cash? How closely your assumptions should mimic reality <i>depends on how important your results (or analysis) are</i>.

### Consider what assumptions you need to mimic reality

#### 1: What are the variables?

| Constraints | Decision variables |
|-------------|--------------------|
| 1. How long to produce | 1. How much of each to produce |
| 2. Cost of production | |
| 3. Profit | |

**... plus**

- real world constraints
- Buyer behaviour
- location

#### 2: What's the objective function?

> ( C<sub><b>1</b></sub>D<sub><b>1</b></sub> ) + ( C<sub><b>2</b></sub>D<sub><b>2</b></sub> ) **= P**

**... plus**

- C<sub><b>3</b></sub>: what sells?
- C<sub><b>4</b></sub>: in which store?
- C<sub><b>5</b></sub>: is there any industry data available?

#### 3: Ask yourself ...

1. What do you want to achieve?
2. What are the constraints?
    1. What's stopping you, or affecting you from getting it?
    2. <b class="highlight highlight-underline">List as many constraints</b> as possible, that you could represent quantatively with data!
