## Filling in the gaps

![](./img/hangman.png)

A mental model helps you <i>fill in the gaps</i> in your knowledge.

- Find problems and gaps in knowledge
- Test these with data wherever possible

Make links between your data and knowledge — your mental model will help you understand the world, filling in the gaps as you go.

> Always include what you don't know, as well as what you do

- What do you know?
- What don't you know?
- What don't you know, you don't know?

**It's ok to be wrong**. you'll make mistakes so just keep asking the question: does it work?



### Your baseline assumptions

> Todays research become assumptions you take into tomorrows research

- <strong>Make your assumptions explicit</strong>
    - so you can recognise errors ...
    - then correct them
- <strong>You can't test everything</strong>
    - but everything should be testable
