## Comparing Data

![It's best to break your data into chunks](./img/chunks.jpg)

Data is <strong>only</strong> interesting when in <strong>comparison</strong> to other data. What changes or patterns do you see?

> Always use the _method of comparison_ in analysis

- _November_ compared to _December_
- One statistic (or data point) compared to another


### Speaking your TRUTH™

> ⚠️ Always make comparisons explicit

1. Clearly state your <i>assumption</i> about the <i>comparison</i>
2. Clearly communicate this to client and yourself
