## Are your observations valid?

- Sometimes a theory will overlap with observational data.
- Sometimes observations will give rise to a theory.
- Observational data is often unlikely to predict the future

### You'll need an experiment if

- Your observational data doesn't describe this theory
- There's not enough data to validate a theory, or give you predictions
- Your observational data isn't strong enough

If any of these are true, it's <strong>just a theory</strong>!
