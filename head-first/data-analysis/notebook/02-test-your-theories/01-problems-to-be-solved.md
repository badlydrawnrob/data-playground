## Problems to be solved

### What, exactly is the problem?

There's a few ways to gauge the problem:

1. Client interviews
2. Customer interviews
3. Personas or archetypes

Gather your **baseline set of assumptions** about their problems. They won't necessarily true as these can be _feelings_ (not _facts_), but it's a good place to start:

1. Define the problem
2. Write your client (or customer) story
    + Tasks they want to perform
    + Assumptions they might have
3. Write down their _baseline set of assumptions_
