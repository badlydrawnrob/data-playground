## Finding the TRUTH™

> TRUTH™ is somewhere between _**what they say**_ and _**what they do**_

Let's take the example of a meal out. Jim is asked by the waiter "was everything ok for you?"

- Does he answer honestly?
- Or does he say what they want to hear?

Perceptions are not always the same as _objective_ behaviour. Conversations help us empathise through _speech_ and _feeling_ (empathy) — but always check your facts:

- <b>Qualitative</b> _gathers_ insights
- <b>Quantitative</b> _validates_ insights (always test theories)

It takes a little of both!
