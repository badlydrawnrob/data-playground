## Dealing with probability words

![](./img/unsure.jpg)

If you have a hunch, a mental model, belief or state, it's easy to say how you feel; but that's often fuzzy. People have differing opinions, or opinions change over time. It's not unusual for people to say things like:

- "It's **highly likely** that cuddly toys will sell next year"
- "I think they **might** prefer to buy ice-cream in summer"
- "Russia will **probably** continue to support oil next quarter"
- "My customers are **more likely than not** going to love this new product line"

These are **probability words**. Probability words don't give a good enough indication how _likely_ something is (or isn't) going to happen. They can't be quantified, they're open to disagreement, they're highly subjective.

### Ask better questions, get better answers

There is a way we can turn vague, subjective words into **actionable insights**:

1. Look at the topics of conversation. Where are the probability words?
2. Break down the statement(s) into key points
3. Simplify these into questions, that can be asked in a survey
4. Ask participants to answer with a number, or percentage
5. Analyse the results

The answers are still subjective, and are only as good as their input. Misleading or deceptive input is still a risk, but it's a clearer indication of current thinking. In fact, it helps you think.

### The results are clearer

| probability word | percentage point |
|------------------|------------------|
| certainly | 100%
| might | 50%
| likely | 70%
| definite | 99%

Quantifying probability words in this way answers the following questions:

1. Which are hot topics of debate?
2. Which are in agreement (it may be closer than you think!)
3. Which statements need more clarifying or research?
