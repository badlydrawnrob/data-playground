## Elements of control

> Always ask for this data

When receiving a brief, it's helpful to collect data and group it by:

- Elements you <em>can</em> control
- Elements you <em>can not</em> control

### Decision variables and constraints

> The balance of your _decision variables_ and your _constraints_ determine your profit

| 1. Things you can control | 2. Things you can't control |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| _Decision variables (can alter profit)_ | _Constraints (can't alter profit)_ |
| — How much <i>Brand A</i> to buy | — Cost of each brand (wholesale) |
| — How much <i>Brand B</i> to buy | — How profitable each brand is |
| | — How much it costs to deliver |
| | — How long it takes to deliver |
