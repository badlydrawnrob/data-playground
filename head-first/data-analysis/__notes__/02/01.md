## Problems to be solved

Personas -vs- Problem-Personas

> 💬 What they say || <mark>TRUTH</mark> || 👍 What they do

- [ ] Qualitative should be tested with quantitative
    - Perceptions are not always the same as _objective_ behaviour

## Comparing Data

> Always use the <mark>method of comparison</mark> in analysis

- [ ] Data is <strong>only</strong> interesting when in <strong>comparison</strong> to other data.
    - <b>November</b> compared to <b>December</b>
    - One statistic compared to other statistics

> Always make comparisons <mark>explicit</mark>

1. It needs to clearly state the <i>assumption</i> about the <i>comparison</i>
2. It needs to communicate to client and yourself

### 👁️ Observational Data

> Qualitative doesn't tell the whole story, but gathers insights for further experimentation

1. Watch. Observe.
2. See what they do.
3. See what groups they assign themselves to.
4. Take inventory (track observations)

### Flipping the theory

Sometimes you'll have to flip the theory to see if the opposite is going on. A good example of this is <b>value perception</b>:

- Is it a customer sense of value for their money?
    - <q>The price is too high for what you're giving me!</q>
- Or does a customer value something more when the price is higher?
    - <q>The price is too cheap! It mustn't be good quality!</q>

> 🙄 Observational data has it's limitations
