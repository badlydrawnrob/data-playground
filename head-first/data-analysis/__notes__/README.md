## != To review

- Should I use `aside` over `blockquote` if it's not a direct quote?
    - Is the `blockquote` just for **[ACTUAL QUOTES](https://quinnlabs.com/articles/pullquotes-blockquotes-and-asides-in-html5/)**?
    - `<aside class="aside-error"></aside>`
        - Can be removed without reducing the meaning of the content
    - Or `<figure>`?

## Visual presentation

- `b`: underlined stressed
- `i`: technical details, names, places, translation
- `mark`:
    - highlighted for reference purposes, due to its relevance in another context
        - i.e: inside a `q` or a `blockquote` to highlight pertinent passages
    - relevant to a users current activity:
        - i.e: search term, misspelled words, selected content in a web app
- `span`:
    - Blocks of content to be visually styled with css

## Importance

- `strong`: stressed, of strong importance
    - Does not change the meaning of the sentence
- `em`: stressed, emphasis on the word or sentence
    - Changes the meaning of the sentence (Cats _are_ cute)
    - Verbal stress
    - [possibly] to compare and contrast in context
- `q`: inline quotations
- `blockquote`: long form (block) quotations
    - `blockquote` > `mark`:
      - Highlight interesting parts of original text
  - `blockquote` > `b`:
      - Highlight errors or gotchas
      - `blockquote` > `b` > `mark`
  - `blockquote` > `i`:
      - Italics (!= do we need?)
- [`cite`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite): A book, research paper, essay or reference to source material
    - Can be used within a paragraph
    - [Debatable])https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5460356/html5-block-quote-with-author): Can be used within a `blockquote`
    - Could also use a `footer` in the `blockquote` with a `cite` for the source (author or work)
    - Possibly use a `<a href="#" rel="author">` tag for the author
        - Basically *no one fucking knows*
