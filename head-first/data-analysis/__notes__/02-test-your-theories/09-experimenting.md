## Experimenting

> You might have two or more theories: <mark>You need an experiment!</mark>

You'd like to find out why people aren't buying.

1. Mark thinks it's a _pricing_ problem (discount, reduce price)
2. Ben thinks it's a _perception_ problem (rebrand)

Who's right?

### It's important to set a baseline

Let's take Mark's theory. If we went ahead and changed price across all stores, we can never be quite sure if our changes were the _real_ reason for failure or success!

- **Set a baseline control group**
    - An A/B test or experiment
    - A multivariate test
- **What would've happened _without_ the experiment?**
    - Did it have the desired effect?
    - Have you ruled out any confounders?

You can't <em>always</em> set a control, but always aim to.
