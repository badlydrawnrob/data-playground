## Randomise

When you randomise, the factors that might otherwise become confounders get equal representation in control/experiment groups.

### An example confounder ...

Here's a group of people we want to test an experiment on:

The experiment groups should be random. This equals out any potential <i>confounders</i>, as each should contain them in equal amounts. They are essentially the same, other than the variable you're testing for.

- [x] This is the case, <b>even if you don't know what the confounder is!</b>
    - [ ] Ideally you'd equal out everything _except_ the variable you're testing for, but that's best case scenario.

1. First try to avoid any obvious confounders, like location
    - [ ] See Starbuzz example [**pg: 67** grouping by micro-regions]
2. Next, <b>randomly assign</b> those groups to the <b>control</b> and <b>experiment</b>
