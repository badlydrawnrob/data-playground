## Problems to be solved

### What, exactly is the problem?

There's a few ways to gauge the problem:

1. Client interviews
2. Customer interviews
3. Personas or archetypes

Gather your **baseline set of assumptions** about their problems. They won't necessarily true as these can be _feelings_ (not _facts_), but it's a good place to start:

1. Define the problem
2. Write your client (or customer) story
    + Tasks they want to perform
    + Assumptions they might have
3. Write down their _baseline set of assumptions_

### Finding the TRUTH™

> TRUTH™ is somewhere between _**what they say**_ and _**what they do**_

Let's take the example of a meal out. Jim is asked by the waiter "was everything ok for you?"

- Does he answer honestly?
- Or does he say what they want to hear?

Perceptions are not always the same as _objective_ behaviour. Conversations help us empathise through _speech_ and _feeling_ (empathy) — but always check your facts:

- <b>Qualitative</b> _gathers_ insights
- <b>Quantitative</b> _validates_ insights (always test theories)

It takes a little of both!



## Comparing Data

![It's best to break your data into chunks](./img/chunks.jpg)

Data is <strong>only</strong> interesting when in <strong>comparison</strong> to other data. What changes or patterns do you see?

> Always use the _method of comparison_ in analysis

- _November_ compared to _December_
- One statistic (or data point) compared to another


### Speaking your TRUTH™

> Always make comparisons <mark>explicit</mark>

1. Clearly state your <i>assumption</i> about the <i>comparison</i>
2. Clearly communicate this to client and yourself



## Observational Data

Qualitative doesn't tell the whole story, but gathers insights for further experimentation:

1. Watch. Observe.
2. See what they do.
3. See what groups they assign themselves to.
4. Take inventory (track observations)


### Flipping the theory

Sometimes you'll have to flip the theory to see if the opposite is going on. A good example of this is <b>value perception</b>:

- Is it a customer sense of value for their money?
    - <q>The price is too high for what you're giving me!</q>
- Or does a customer value something more when the price is higher?
    - <q>The price is too cheap! It mustn't be good quality!</q>

##### Observational data has it's limitations

- Be careful you're not drawing the wrong conclusions
    - Take observational data with a pinch of salt


## Say it in pictures

Draw pictures of how you think things relate. This helps you make your ideas explicit and easy to view at-a-glance.
