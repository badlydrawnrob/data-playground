## Observational Data

![](./img/people-watching.jpg)

Qualitative doesn't tell the whole story, but gathers insights for further experimentation:

1. Watch. Observe.
2. See what they do.
3. See what groups they assign themselves to.
4. Take inventory (track observations)


### Flipping the theory

Sometimes you'll have to flip the theory to see if the opposite is going on. A good example of this is <b>value perception</b>:

- Is it a customer sense of value for their money?
    - <q>The price is too high for what you're giving me!</q>
- Or does a customer value something more when the price is higher?
    - <q>The price is too cheap! It mustn't be good quality!</q>

#### ⚠️ Beware of first impressions
##### Observational data has it's limitations

- Data can sometimes lead you down the wrong path ...
- Be careful you're not drawing the wrong conclusions
    - Take observational data with a pinch of salt
