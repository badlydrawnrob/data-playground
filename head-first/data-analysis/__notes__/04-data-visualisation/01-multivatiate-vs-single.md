### Scatterplots

A scatterplot explores <i class="highlight highlight-italic">causes</i>. It's an example of <i class="highlight highlight-italic">exploratory data analysis</i> (having a peak at the data that needs testing).

When creating a scatterplot, you're asking two main questions:

1. What is your objective or goal?
2. What are the expected causes for this goal to move <abbr title="up">â†‘</abbr> or <abbr title="up">â†“</abbr>?

You then look at two varables together: the thing you're testing (potential "cause", or `x`); the goal or objective (`y`):

```
x = independent variable
y = dependent variable
```

### An example scatterplot

![revenue and time on site]()

> **Example:** objective = $revenue

Here we can see our `ðŸ˜€ customer` spent:

1. `x = 10` minutes on the site
2. `y = 40` dollars worth of stuff
