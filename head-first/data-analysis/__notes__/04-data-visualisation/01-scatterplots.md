## Scatterplots

![](./img/x-causes-y.jpg)

**A scatterplot explores <i class="highlight highlight-italic">causes</i>**. It's an example of <i class="highlight highlight-italic">exploratory data analysis</i> (having a peak at the data that needs testing) where you're asking two main questions:

1. What is your objective or goal?
2. What are the expected causes for this goal to move <abbr title="up">â†‘</abbr> or <abbr title="up">â†“</abbr>?

Look at two variables together:

1. **`x`: independent variable** the thing you're testing (potential cause)
2. **`y`: dependent variable** the goal or objective

Ask yourself:

- Does one variable affect another?
- Does one variable affect the objective, or goal?

### An example scatterplot

> Our objective is to maximise $revenue

![The circles are the intersection between `x` and `y`](./img/time-on-site.jpg)

Here we can see our `ðŸ˜€ customer` spent:

1. `x = 10` minutes on the site
2. `y = 40` dollars worth of stuff
