## Analyse like a human

> The world is wiggly. It's often too complicated to achieve the perfect result.

In an ideal world, you'd be able to connect, process and analyse _all_ the data you'd need to make a decision. Just tweak a few decision variables and <strong class="highlight highlight-uppercase">boom!</strong> you've got the perfect result.

That's not how the real world works, often it's more like this:

- Too many moving parts or variables
- Too hard, expensive, or time-consuming to collect
- Complex ðŸ’­ <i class="highlight highlight-italic">mental models</i> or ðŸ“Š <i class="highlight highlight-italic">decision variables</i> to manipulate

It's not sensible to focus on one variable (or KPI) when there might be equally valid, easier to gather data available â€” especially if that variable is complicated, expensive, or time-consuming.


## An optimisation function is the ideal, not the rule

> Keep it simple. You don't need to know everything ... you just need to pick the right indicators of success!

An optimisation function is a data analysts dream. This often just isn't possible (or practical) if the data suffers from the problems mentioned above. Sometimes, the best you can hope for is to <b class="highlight highlight-bold">pick the right variables</b> that will give a good indication of your objective.

Pick a small number of the variables you think It won't be the perfect model, or give you the absolute `max()` or `min()` of your objective; it will save you time, money, effort â€” and a lot of headaches.

## Heuristics

```text
1. (Psychological definition) Substituting a difficult or confusing attribute for a more accessible one.
2. (Computer science definition) A way of solving a problem that will tend to give you accurate answers but that does not guarantee optimality.
```

When the question is complex, the brain falls back on decision-making variables â€”Â or heuristics â€”Â that help us decide. The brain isn't good at processing <em>all</em> possible variables or factors; it picks _easier ones_ to decide.

![Hard ðŸ’­ --> Make up my own easier ðŸ’­ --> decide]()

- It's far more efficient
- It costs less in time, money or mental effort
- It's simple, and often works well

The brain is fallible. It won't be perfect, but it's far easier than the alternative.


### Most of your thinking as a data analyst is heuristic

> Some psychologists even argue that all human reasoning is heuristic and that optimisation is an ideal that only works when your problems are _ultra-specified_

Use the right tool, for the right job. If you're problem is super specific; your decision variables and assumptions are clear and simple; use an optimisation tool when you can. For most other problems, your thinking will be heuristic. Remember, a data analyst:

- Breaks the problem into <b class="highlight highlight-bold">manageable pieces</b>
- Fitting <abbr title="mental models">ðŸ’­</abbr> and <abbr title="statistical models">ðŸ“ˆ</abbr> to data to make a decision or judgement

There are <strong class="highlight highlight-uppercase">no guarantees</strong>! All you're trying to do is find optimal results.
