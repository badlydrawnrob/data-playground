## How do you pick the right variables?

Once you have a broad view of the problem, understand the moving parts and variables you can measure:

1. First, ask yourself "what's feasible to measure?"
2. Which are too expensive, difficult, or time-consuming?
3. Which might solve our question, or validate our objective/goal?
4. Does it fit the brief, or the clients mental model?

### Remember, the client has their own heuristics

#### Customer heuristics: how they decide

> The council don't care about your public opinion survey. They want hard data, not fuzzy feelings.

Every customer or client has their own heuristics:

- How does your customer think?
- What drives their decisions?
- Are they what you think?
- Are they realistic?

#### Data analyst: how you convince

> Monitoring tonnage isn't feasible. It's too hard. What do we need to convince them otherwise?

Your job is to understand customer heuristics and understand their reasoning. You then use this as a basis for your own analysis, helping them decide.

- How might you integrate them into your analysis?
- What facts or figures would you need?
- Do they prove your point?
- ... or disprove it? (be honest)
