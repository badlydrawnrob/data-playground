2. **Heuristics** are seeing a few options
3. <s>**Optimisation** is seeing all options</s>

Most decision making uses heuristics; we can use a **[fast and frugal tree](https://www.r-bloggers.com/making-fast-good-decisions-with-the-fftrees-r-package/)** to break a problem into manageable pieces, figure out easier ways to make a decision:

- Far more efficient
- Cost less in time, money or mental effort
- Simple, and often work well


### Who are you trying to convince?

> The council don't care about your public opinion survey. They want hard data, not fuzzy feelings.

Remember, your client also has their own mental model:

- How does your customer think?
- What drives their decisions?
- Are they what you think?
- Are they realistic?

### It's your job to convince them

> The goal they're asking for isn't feasible. It's too hard.

Understand your customer's decision making process â€” use this as a basis for your own analysis, helping them decide. If the goal is impossible to analyse, could you do it by proxy?

- Agree on a clearly defined outcome
- What facts or figures would you need?
- Do they prove your point?
- ... or disprove it? (be honest)
