# Introduction to data analysis

## Mental models

> Always make your mental modals as explicit as possible

Give your mental models the same <b>serious</b>, <b>careful</b> treatment as <b>data</b>.

### Question everything

Be careful of blindly following one perspective or mode of thought.

> You're attracted to what compels you.

In other words, <strong>what you focus on _matters_</strong>. The world will represent to you what you believe. Your mental model will reveal the features of the world you focus on.

For example: üç∏ Hipster place -vs- ‚òï A regular place

I perceive a hipster place as <i>superficial</i> and <i>exclusive</i>.

<i>Meaning</i> is what draws you in. Focus is what has <i>meaning</i> for you.
