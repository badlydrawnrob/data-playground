## Mental models

> Always make your <mark>mental modals as explicit as possible</mark>

Give your mental models the same <b>serious</b>, <b>careful</b> treatment as <b>data</b>.

### Question everything

<strong>So, what you focus on _matters_</strong>: the world will represent to you what you believe. Be careful of blindly following one perspective or mode of thought.

Your mental model will reveal the features of the world you focus on. Take, for example:

1. 🍸 Hipster place
2. ☕ A regular place

I perceive a hipster place as <i>superficial</i> and <i>exclusive</i> — that doesn't make it true.

- <i>Meaning</i> is what draws you in.
- Focus is what has <i>meaning</i> for you.
