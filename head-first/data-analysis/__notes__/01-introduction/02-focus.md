## Filling in the gaps

![](./img/hangman.png)

A mental model helps you <i>fill in the gaps</i> in your knowledge.

- Find problems and gaps in knowledge
- Test these with data wherever possible

Make links between your data and knowledge â€”Â your mental model will help you understand the world, filling in the gaps as you go.

> Always include what you don't know, as well as what you do

- What do you know?
- What don't you know?
- What don't you know, you don't know?

**It's ok to be wrong**. you'll make mistakes so just keep asking the question: does it work?



### Your baseline assumptions

> Todays research become assumptions you take into tomorrows research

- <strong>Make your assumptions explicit</strong>
    - so you can recognise errors ...
    - then correct them
- <strong>You can't test everything</strong>
    - but everything should be testable




## FOCUS

![Your mental model and baseline assumptions help you find your focus](./img/define-the-problem.jpg)

<strong>Stay focused on what you're trying to achieve</strong>, no matter how much data you have at your disposal.

1. Your mental model
2. Your baseline assumptions
3. Together, become your focus ðŸ”¦





## It's an ongoing process

Data analysis is an ongoing process. You can't know everything and todays success could be tomorrows failure.

1. <b>Add new data</b> when it becomes available
2. <b>Reassess your mental model</b> often:
    - Your mental model influences your data model
    - Your data model influences your mental model
- <b>Stay focused on your goals</b> and <b>make your assumptions explicit</b>
