## When new information appears

> Extra! Extra! A new source of information changes the mood ...

When you get new information, or things change, it's a good idea to reassess people's assumptions or predictions.

- A new source of information may be reliable, misleading, or false
- It doesn't mean your analysis is wrong, but it should be adjusted to compensate
    + It _only_ describes Truth‚Ñ¢ at ‚è±Ô∏è w/ üí≠
- Prepare a new survey, with a subjective probability based on the new intel.


## Bayes' rule to the rescue!

If the stakes are high, you don't just want to ask for new subjective probabilities. A more rigorous way of incorporating new info is to use Bayes' rule: this helps avoid people overcompensating for their previous answers.


![Bayes' formula allows you to feed in the new subjective probabilities, using the old ones as a base](./img/bayes-rule-formula.jpg)

##¬†Now ... compare old with new

Simply create another scatterplot with the new results, comparing this with the previous visuals.

1. What does this tell you?
2. Do these new subjective probabilities change your mind?
3. What are the next steps?
