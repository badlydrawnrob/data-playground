  # Fruits (all)
  
  > Use nested style if you're going to use foreign keys with auto-Pydantic models. Unfortunately using `exclude=Fruits.id` does not remove it (renders as `null`)
  
  For this reason and others, it's probably best for most circumstances to simply create your own custom Pydantic return type. Separate concerns.
