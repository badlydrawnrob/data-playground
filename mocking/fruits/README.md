> A fruits API using Python and the [Piccolo](https://piccolo-orm.com/) ecosystem!

This mocking example is based on Elm Land's [fruits API](https://github.com/elm-land/elm-land/tree/main/examples/06-query-parameters) to see the difference in speed and efficiency of Elm-based queries compared to SQLite and FastAPI.

1. For users it uses business identifiers as well as serial `ID`.
2. Authentication uses the `BaseUser` table and [`BaseUser.login()`](https://piccolo-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/piccolo/authentication/baseuser.html#login-login-sync) function
3. Piccolo uses [seperate packages](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/issues/1272) for it's Admin and API.
    - Ideally you could `uv add 'piccolo-api[sqlite]'` and `scaffold --fastapi`


## Dependencies

> A big concerns is having too many dependencies!

Just keep an eye on how fast these are changing and what impact it has on your maintenance.


## Bugs

### Naming conventions

> Have a naming convention and stick to it: singular or plural?

- Table `Fruit` or `Fruits`?
- Model `FruitModelIn` or `FruitsModelIn`?
- Folder `fruit` or `fruits`? (package)

### ðŸ¤– Ai fails hard

> Trying to understand `lifespan` and `contextlib` was a big fat fail!

- [Using LLMs](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/) for coding
- Be extremely careful letting Ai handle critical parts of your app (human in the loop)


## SQLite

> Piccolo is one of the easiest ways to query your data (see [ORM challenges](https://piccolo-orm.com/blog/orm-design-challenges/))

- Peewee was great but not setup for `async` (although it has an [untested plugin](https://peewee-async.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html))
- SQLModel is an abstraction of an abstraction (SQLAlchemy) and feels bloated to me

SQLModel uses the Data Mapper pattern rather than Active Record and is a little more confusing with `.session.exec()`, add, commit, etc, whereas Piccolo needs no `connect()` or `close()` functions as it's `select()` queries are handled automatically. Peewee and Piccolo have an object oriented style, but (I think) only Piccolo has a functional data style. Piccolo feels a lot lighter and easier to wrap your head around!

The downside of using SQLite over Postgres is data integrity (without [strict tables](https://www.sqlite.org/stricttables.html)) and data types. Some SQLite fields are stored as `json`, which will require a [plugin](https://sqlite.org/json1.html) to query them, or use [`sqlite-utils`](https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli-reference.html) (with `--json-cols`) and `jq`.
    
The upsides are Piccolo gives a wider range of [columns](https://piccolo-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/piccolo/schema/column_types.html) to work with, so whereas SQLite only has `1` (`True`) and `0` (`False`) for boolean values, Piccolo will add them as [proper (`json`)](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/issues/1257) types. You also have to be careful with [empty `String`](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/issues/353) values.

Postgres is _far_ more capable than SQLite but is also harder to setup, store, and migrate data (it's documentation is huge).


## User experience

> See the "Van Man Problem" for API architecture and design.

1. `Delete` operations should always prompt the user to confirm.
2. Handle errors correctly. Don't leak sensitive information.
3. Authenticate all routes that require authentication, or are "risky".
    - Make sure it's the correct user that is allowed to edit their posts.
4. What data should be public? What data should be private?
