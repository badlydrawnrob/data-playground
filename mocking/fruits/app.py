# Fruits demo app (Piccolo ORM)
# ==============================================================================
# > Treat some parts of the app as a "black box" and stick to your learning frame
#
# 1. FastApi with models and routes (API layer)
# 2. Piccolo ORM (async data layer) for CRUD operations
#    - Peewee isn't setup for async @ https://charlesleifer.com/blog/asyncio/
#
# It seems best to split out the API layer from the DATA layer, so each could be
# swapped out independently (SQLModel is too tightly connected). Changing ORMs
# and databases can be tricky and time consuming! There's too much to learn, so
# aim for "just in time" learning. What's not my job?
#
#
# Learning frame
# --------------
# 1. ✅ Static typed functional python where it makes sense (rrr classes, Elm style)
# 2. ✅ Simple and minimal data structures with a simple API (rrr file size)
# 3. ✅ Understanding API route architecture decisions (# of endpoints)
# 4. ✅ Understanding backend data structures (especially search queries)
# 5. ✅ Aiming to keep data shapes flat where possible (avoid nesting?)
# 6. ✅ Remove code duplication. Simplify your code. 5 steps (Tesla)
# 7. ✅ Maximise readability and maintainability (my stupid future self)
#
# 1. ❌ ~~Security: authentication and more~~
#     - is owner of data, is logged on, etc
#     - Malicious SQL injections and DDOS attacks.
#
#
# Piccolo ORM
# -----------
# 1. Piccolo by default uses `engine_finder` from `piccolo_conf.py`
# 2. Piccolo can automatically create tables from your models
#    - @ https://piccolo-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/piccolo/query_types/create_table.html
# 3. Piccolo connects and closes database with a single function (careful with async writes)
#    - @ https://piccolo-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/piccolo/tutorials/fastapi.html#transactions
#    - @ https://tinyurl.com/piccolo-sqlite-tips-concurrent (database locked error)
#
#
# SQLite transactions
# -------------------
# > Always use a `DataModelIn` before saving to SQLite as it's not strict.
#
# 1. Async transactions can fail if you `select()` followed by a write.
#     - Be very careful and use the correct transaction type where needed.
#     - @ https://tinyurl.com/piccolo-sqlite-and-asyncio
#     - @ https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/discussions/1247
# 2. SQL is waaay quicker at search filters than Elm or Python so ...
#    - `await Task.select().where(Task.id == task_id)` ... GOOD!
#    - `if list: for i in list: if i.id == task_id:`   ... BAD!
#
#
# Improvements
# ------------
# 1. Aim for beautiful, readable, ELi5 code (my stupid future self)
#     - I shouldn't need to be an expert to understand Piccolo!
#     - Elm code uses a lot of whitespace which I prefer
#     - If something can be simplified or removed, do so
# 2. Do not include needless packages where they can be avoided
#     - Code and dependencies should follow a miniamlist approach
# 3. Code should be pitched at the right level of ability and knowledge
#     - Advanced features should be hidden for begginers (like `Readable`)
# 4. Code should follow expectations setup from other parts of the documentation
#     - `playground run` is using a `Band` database, so why not here?
# 5. Aim for faster loading while still sticking to the above
#     - Which code is faster in an object oriented style? (e.g: find task with id)
#     - If speed is negligible, prefer readable and functional style
#
#
# Questions
# ---------
# 1. Do we need `@app.on_event("startup")` or `lifespan` event handlers?
#    - How does Piccolo handle setting up the database?
# 2. When does async break with SQLite? (`.select()` + write operations)
# 3. How to have a high-level view of data and flow so everything makes sense?
#    - As your application grows it can be hard to understand.
# 4. Are `id` fields handled automatically by Piccolo?
# 5. Where is it better to use raw SQL instead of an ORM?
#    - At scale performance can be an issue with ORM queries.
# 6. Where to use `PUT` vs `PATCH` requests? (all data or some data)
# 7. When to use ATOMIC vs DYNAMIC routes? (Elm Spa Article forms)
#    - e.g: `/user/{id}/fruits` (POST)
#    - e.g: `/user/{id}/fruits/{fruit_id}` (ADD/DELETE, -vs- `List Int`)
# 8. Are `Int` id joins faster than `String` joins? (email as id)
# 9. When to use abstraction to reduce code duplication?
# 10. ~~Are results cached?~~ (later/never)
#    - @ https://www.powersync.com/blog/sqlite-optimizations-for-ultra-high-performance
# 11. Avoid admin routes? (make sure Piccolo admin is protected)
#    - ~~@ https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/security/oauth2-scopes/~~
# 12. Potentially use SQLite Utils to easily setup mock data?
# 13. Consider different `include_router` packages for authentication routes?
#    - @ https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/
#    - @ https://stackoverflow.com/a/67318405
# 14. Add logging for FastApi on the production server?
#    - @ https://tinyurl.com/prep-fastapi-for-production
# 15. Change `.env` settings to something simpler?
#    - By default `.env` files don't handle dictionaries.
#    - You store it as a `json` string, then convert to a dictionary
#
#
# Errors
# ------
# 1. Tighten up the types?
# 2. SQLiteEngine has no `connect()` and `close()` functions?
#     - This should be documented somewhere.
#
#
# Wishlist
# --------
# 1. Create a script that automatically creates mock data
#    - Use `sqlite-utils` or Piccolo itself
# 2. Add SQLite transactions (see docs)
#    - Test concurrent connections and writes
#    - @ https://piccolo-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/piccolo/tutorials/fastapi.html#transactions
# 3. Better documentation for SQLite and `engine_finder()`
#    - Setup with FastAPI
#    - Setup database, opening and closing connections, and so on.
#    - Does SQLite have connection pooling?
# 4. Understand how Piccolo apps work a bit better?
#     - @ https://piccolo-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/piccolo/projects_and_apps/
# 5. Investigate `case` in Python`
#     - @ https://stackoverflow.com/a/11479840 (Python 3.10+)
# 6. Understand and implement the `BaseUser` table properly
#    - And how does it differ from `piccolo_user` table?
#    - @ https://github.com/sinisaos/simple-piccolo/blob/main/fastapi_app.py#L73
#    - @ https://piccolo-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/piccolo/authentication/baseuser.html#baseuser
#    - @ https://piccolo-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/piccolo/authentication/baseuser.html#extending-baseuser
# 7. Decide whether to persue Migrations or just use JQ and `sqlite-utils`
#    - Migrations are a little advanced for beginners
#    - Auto migrations do not work with SQLite
# 8. How best to reduce the surface area of XSS attacks?
#    - Do we need to sanitize text if it's not rendered as HTML or used in SQL?
# 9. What's the best method to insert one-to-many relationships?
#    - See the `tables.py` file for more notes.
# 10. Harden validating fields and routes ...
#    - Fields are not empty and not null, for example

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Setting up the database
# ==============================================================================
# > This part of the app can be treated like a black box. You only need to know
# > what it does, not how.
#
# 1. `create_admin` only registers the tables for the view (not create them)
# 2. `create_tables()` or `create_db_tables()` creates the DB and tables.
#
# 
# Migrations
# ----------
# > I feel like this is an advanced topic and there's other ways to do it.
# 
# SQLite does not have automatic migrations currently. Use `sqlite-utils`.
#
#
# 🤖 Ai summary: What the fuck is a context manager?
# --------------------------------------------------
# > @ https://medium.com/@marcnealer/fastapi-after-the-getting-started-867ecaa99de9
#
# It ensures that setup (like opening a file) happens when you start using the resource,
# and cleanup (like closing the file) happens when you're done, even if an error occurs.
#
# - What exactly should be setup on startup? Shutdown?
# - The essential is to create our database and setup the tables.
#
# I've not come across this the Elm world and the `contextlib` docs really don't
# do a great job of explaining it, or why I should care. In fact I find the whole
# concept of `async` a little weird, scattering around `async` and `await` keywords
# all over the place. It feels like it should be built into the language.
#
#
# 🤖 Ai summary: `yield`
# ----------------------
# > The lifespan allows us to define startup and teardown in one function
#
# The code block before the yield executes during the startup phase, just before
# the application begins to accept requests. This is where you can perform expensive
# operations like loading a model or establishing a database connection. The yield
# acts as a pause point, after which the application becomes operational and can
# handle incoming requests. The code block after the yield executes during the
# shutdown phase, after the application has finished processing all requests.
#
#
# 🤖 Ai fails
# -----------
# It took an unnecessary amount of time to understand lifespan etc. It's easier
# than the web would have you believe, but there's not many ELi5 resources. Do
# not attempt to use Ai to do this for you, as it gave me a MASSIVE and WRONG
# code sample, even though it crawled the Piccolo docs, which goes to show it can't
# (yet) be trusted for critical tasks. Does this mean the docs need improving?
# At least for a bot to crawl them.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Initiate the app (with Piccolo Admin)
# ==============================================================================
# > We're extending `FastAPI` here to add Piccolo's Admin interface
#
# 1. `StaticFiles` does NOT serve static files by default (why not?!) so you've
#     got to explicitly tell it to. We're using the fastapi package (not starlette)
# 2. `Mount` is a FastAPI advanced feature (maybe not great for quickstart). The
#    current `agsi new` command uses Starlette, but possibly best to use FastAPI?
#    - @ https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/sub-applications/
# 3. It seems `create_admin` function automatically creates the tables?
#    - If so `@asynccontextmanager` above is not needed?
#    - I'm not super keen on the `tables=` argument. Better to be explicit and
#      list all tables here? Do we _really_ need `APP_CONFIG` at all?
#
# Piccolo Admin
