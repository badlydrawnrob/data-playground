# A basic film API

> Built from this [free film API](https://www.freepublicapis.com/free-movie-api)
> The `json` is MASSIVE. How much of that could've been removed?!

1. `npx json-server film.db`
2. `GET` from `/films`
3. `POST` to `/films/:id`

Used [JQ Playground](https://play.jqlang.org/) to massage the API data (remove the `jq ''` part and change the `tt` id):

```
# url: https://imdb.iamidiotareyoutoo.com/search?tt=tt20969586
>> jq '. | { title: .short.name, trailer: .short.trailer.embedUrl, summary: .short.description, tags: .short.genre }'
```

## Reviews

> Here's [an example](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/thunderbolts/reviews?type=top_critics) of reviews and [how they're scored](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about).

The reviews themselves (I don't think) are binary, but they're converted into a [fresh or rotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes#Critics'_aggregate_score) (binary). There's an [interesting comparison](https://www.pretentious-o-meter.co.uk/) between audience scores and critic's scores.

## Images

> Is it wiser to make sure all images are the same type?

Rotten Tomatoes uses `.png`s, `.jpg`, and if you try to save some they download as `ems.SOME-LONG-ID=` as they're generated by a `https://resizing.flixster.com/` API.
